# Improving Music Denoising Autoencoders: A Comparative Study of Models and Feature Extraction Methods

---

## Introduction
Source Separation has been a forefront of music AI research for the last 10 years. 
What makes music denoising a tricky problem is that it is difficult to define exactly what is music and what is noise, since there is a large amount of overlap between the two. E.g, a filter sweep in electronic music is normally based on uniform random noise, within context, this is music, or maybe some birds tweeting in the background of recodring an acoustic guitarist playing, although pleasant, within context, this would be noise. 
This is presented within the same space as source separation as the solution to the problem is very similar, and hence similar models are used. 
What is presented here is a comparison of several solutions to one problem within the source separation space, Music denoising.
